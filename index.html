                <p>Hey guys ! Thank you for visiting my Basic Portfolio website. It's a real pleasure to be able to create a
                    website from scratch, even though it doesn't have the best look right now.</p>
                <p>Hmm...What should I say about myself ? I'm originally from Bulgaria, recently moved to the States with my
                    wife Andrea, who is an American citizen. We met in my country, while she was on vacation, it was just
                    like a movie scenario.</p>
                <p>We just had our first baby daughter Sofia three months ago. She brings so much joy to our family. Other than
                    that, I work as a Marketing Manager for a car dealership, it's six days a week and that's one of the
                    main reasons for me to look for other opportunities. I want to spend more time with my family.</p>
                <p>My goal is to gain more knowledge that can be used later on in my life. I love challenges and I'm very stubborn.
                    I don't quit easy, so bring it on !</p>
